# Problem Summary:
The client, an AI developer, uses web scraping to gather training data but faces challenges in organizing and ensuring the quality of this data. Specifically, they need a system that:

- **Categorizes training questions separately from answers to support developer self-affirmation. **
- **Ensures balanced training data (free from biases) to improve AI model performance. **
