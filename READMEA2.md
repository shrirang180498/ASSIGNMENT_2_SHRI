# AI Training Data Systems


## Summary
This project aims to develop a system for managing AI training data, with a focus on categorizing training questions and ensuring balanced datasets free from biases. The system will integrate with web scraping tools and provide an intuitive user interface for developers.

## Key Features
- **Categorized Training Questions**: Organize questions by subject, difficulty, or other criteria.
- **Balanced Training Data**: Detect and mitigate biases (e.g., gender, racial, cultural).
- **Scalable & Secure**: Handle large datasets securely with encryption and access control.
- **Web Scraping Integration**: Import data directly from web scraping tools.

## Requirements
### Functional
- Categorize questions and separate them from answers.
- Detect and balance biases in training data.

### System
- Scalable to handle millions of questions.
- Secure data storage with encryption.
- Support for CSV, JSON, and other data formats.

## Assumptions
- Sufficient publicly available data for web scraping.
- Developers are familiar with AI training and data management.
- System will be deployed in a cloud environment.

## Tasks
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Gather and validate client requirements.
2. **System Design**: Design architecture and UI prototypes.
3. **Implementation**: Develop categorization and bias analysis features.
4. **Testing**: Validate the system with sample datasets.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to the cloud and provide documentation.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ASSIGNMENT_2_SHRI.git
